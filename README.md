# ample

ample was a company pitched by my team at the 2020 ORIGIN startup bootcamp pitch competition. We finished in 1st place out of over 250+ students.

See the slides for the customer journey, market sizing, competitive analysis, and more. See the demo video for a walk through of our hi-fi figma prototype.
